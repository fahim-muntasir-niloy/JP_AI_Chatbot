Reasoning
> Okay, the user is asking what they should include in a business plan document. Let me start by recalling the previous conversation. They were interested in rent and subsidies, so it's likely they're applying for a small business subsidy in Japan. The knowledgebase results mentioned documents like the "経営計画書兼補助事業計画書①" which includes company overview, business objectives, financial data, and more. First, I need to structure the answer based on the Japanese context. The user probably needs to know the specific sections required for a subsidy application. The previous tool response had details on office rent, wage calculations, and business plans. So, the business plan should align with those requirements. I should list the key sections from the knowledgebase: company information, business objectives, financial data, operational plans, and supporting documents. Also, mention the specific forms like 標式2 and 標式3. It's important to highlight that the plan must meet subsidy criteria, like sales, profits, and employee numbers. Wait, the user might not just need a general business plan but one tailored for a Japanese subsidy. I should emphasize the Japanese-specific elements, such as using the provided forms and including exact financial figures. Also, mention the need for wage calculations and proof of office rent if applicable. Make sure to check if the knowledgebase has any other relevant sections. The sample documents mentioned things like business objectives, financial statements, and employee numbers. Also, the user might need to know about the structure of the document, like the table of contents and specific pages for each section. I should also include examples from the knowledgebase, like the 標式2 which includes company name, industry, employee count, sales data, etc. And mention the need for a 3-year plan if required by the subsidy. Finally, remind them to follow the guidelines strictly and use the provided forms to avoid rejection.

2. **Detailed Business Plan**: 3-year goals, investment costs, and specific use of subsidies (e.g., office rent, equipment).
